    <div id="example">
        <p>this is a dive that makes an example of attribute selectors</p>
    </div>
        <p>Remember, you can use attribute selectors like this "div[id]{color: blue}"
            and it makes all the divs with an id looking the same in css</p><br>

        <p>What is more if you want all the ids within a div that part of the names is the same you can use
        <u>div[id~="xxx"]{color: green;}" </u>then all the id within a div that name is similar to xxx will
            have the same look</p>
        <br>
        <p>OR! use <u>"div[id^="xxx"]{...}</u> then everything that <b>begins</b> with xxx
        will look the same</p>
         <br>
         <p>OR! use <u>"div[id$="xxx"]{...}</u> then everything that <b>ends</b> with xxx
             will look the same</p>
